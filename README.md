## Project Information
Our project is called “CodeBash”, which takes a lot of its inspiration from the online typing game called “monkeytype”. Overarchingly, our game aims to provide the user with a tool that can help them improve their typing speed and accuracy.

Additionally, this tool can be used to refamiliarize the user with syntax of programming languages that they are working with, or hoping to maintain.

In an increasingly technical world, having typing skills is fundamental to how we communicate with one another, whether that is essay writing, CSCI 205 labs, or texting. In our opinion, there’s no better way to improve that skill than through the snarky, visually appealing, one of a kind CodeBash game.

## Package Structure

The entire project is contained within the “CodeBash” package. From there, the model for the main game - which contains the game logic and functionality - is contained inside the “model” package, and everything else (including the view, controller, and main class) is outside of that package.

## 3rd Party Libraries Used

JavaFX

## How to Run It
If you have the file on your computer, simply run the “CodeBashMain” main method.

If you’re looking to play from Gitlab, clone the program and type ./gradlew run
